The first project involves using your knowledge of Python libraries for data visualization, including seaborn, plotly, and dash. The project consists of parts that, when combined, will be the final result.

Programming language: Python

Used libraries: seaborn, plotly, dash, google.colab, and threading

Development environment: Google Colab

Dataset: world-wide data on countries during COVID-19 pandemic.

Problem: analysis of the course of the pandemic.

Solution: exported notebook in `*.ipynb' format.

When you view Jupyter notebooks on GitHub, interactive content such as Plotly graphs isn't rendered due to GitHub's static rendering of notebooks. To view interactive visualizations like those created with Plotly, you'll need to run the notebook in an environment that supports these features, such as:

Local Jupyter Notebook: Run the notebook locally using Jupyter in your development environment. This will allow you to interact with all the dynamic features of the notebook.
Google Colab: If your notebook is set up to run in Google Colab, you can open the notebook there and run the cells to see the interactive plots. You can provide a link to the Colab notebook in your GitHub repository for others to view and interact with the plots.
nbviewer: You can use Jupyter's nbviewer service to render the notebook from GitHub with interactive content. Just paste the URL of your GitHub notebook into nbviewer, and it will display with interactive elements like Plotly graphs.
Binder: Binder allows you to run Jupyter notebooks directly from a GitHub repo, providing a virtual environment with all the necessary libraries installed. It's a great way to share interactive content without requiring viewers to install anything locally.
